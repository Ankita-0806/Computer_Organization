## Computer Organization and Architecture

Organization --> ***How does a computer work?***
* Physical aspects of  computer system
* Control signals, interfaces, memory technologies, etc.
* e.g., is there a hardware multiply unit or is to done by repeated additions?

Architecture --> ***How do I design a computer?***
* Logical aspects of computer system implementation as seen by the programmer
* Instruction set, number of bits used for data representation, I/O mechanisms, addressing techniques, etc.
* e.g., is there a multiply instruction?

## Why do we study this subject?
* It explores how machines are designed, built and operated.
* Knowing what's inside will help you design/develop/implement applications in an efficient manner.
* You will be able to make informed and logical decisions instead of relying on a mediocre guessing game.
